## INTRODUCTION

Question

**When we measure something from a sample, do you think it gives us the exact truth about the population? Why or why not?**

## **Objective of the presentation**

-   Learn about uncertainty in statistics.

-   Explore tools like confidence intervals, margins of error, and bootstrapping.

-   Understand different types of uncertainty and their role in decision-making.

## What is Uncertainty in Statistics?

Whenever we use a **sample** to estimate something about a **population**, there’s always some uncertainty.

-   **Randomness**: Every sample is different.

-   **Measurement Errors**: Mistakes or variability in data collection.

## Confidence Intervals

-   It’s a range where the true value is likely to be.

    Example: A survey says 52% of people support a policy with a 95% CI of ±3%.

    -   This means the true support is likely between **49% and 55%**.

## MARGINS OF ERROR

**What is Margin of Error?**

-   It tells us how much the result could vary because of sampling.

-   Example: A poll result of 40% with a margin of error of ±5% means the true value is between **35% and 45%**.

Please note - Larger samples reduce the margin of error.

## BOOTSRTAPPING

Bootstrapping method to measure the uncertainty in data using the data itself!

-   **Why It’s Useful**:

    -   Works well for small samples or unusual data where normal methods fail.

    -   Helps us see how stable our results are.

## ALEATORY VS EPISTEMIC

### **Aleatory Uncertainty**

Aleatory uncertainty results from a system or process's natural randomness. This type of variability arises spontaneously and is predictable overall over a large number of situations yet unpredictable for individual cases.

**Examples**:

1.  The outcome of rolling a dice.

2.  The weather on a specific day (due to natural variability).

3.  The lifespan of light bulbs (random failure times).

## **Epistemic Uncertainty**

Epistemic uncertainty arises from incomplete knowledge or imperfect information about a system. It reflects the limitations in our understanding and can be reduced by gathering more data or improving models.

**Examples**:

1.  Estimating the average height of a population from a small sample.

2.  Predicting the effect of a new drug with limited trial data.

3.  Forecasting the number of fish in a lake based on incomplete survey data.

## DIFFERENCES

| Aspect | Aleatory | Epistemic |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Source | Internal variability or randomness | Lack of Knowledge or Data |
| Can it be changed? | No, its naturally in your system | Yes, through more data |
| Examples | Rolling of a dice | Calculating population values that are unknown |
| How to address it? | Make use of predictive models. | Gather more data |

## QUESTION

### Confidence Intervals

\
*If a poll says 60% of students love chocolate with a 95% CI of ±4%, what does this mean?*\
a) Everyone loves chocolate.\
b) The true percentage is definitely 60%.\
c) The true percentage likely lies between 56% and 64%.\
d) The poll has no uncertainty.

## QUESTION

### Margins of Error

What happens to the margin of error if you increase the sample size?\
a) It stays the same.\
b) It gets smaller.\
c) It gets larger.\
d) It doubles.

## QUESTION

### Bootstrapping

Why might bootstrapping be useful?\
a) It reduces randomness.\
b) It works for small samples and unusual data.\
c) It gives the exact true value of the population.\
d) It doesn’t require sampling.

## Classify the following situations into Aleatory or Epistemic

1\) Drawing a card from a shuffled deck

2\) Determining the outcome of a medical treatment with limited clinical trial data

3\) Determining the exact number of people attending a large concert based on incomplete ticket sales data

## OVERALL QUIZ

**What are two key ways to handle uncertainty in statistics?**\
a) Ignoring it and focusing on the average.\
b) Using confidence intervals and resampling methods like bootstrapping.\
c) Relying on randomness alone.\
d) Collecting as little data as possible to avoid complications.
